|**2025-03-09**|**[Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/ddvd233/climb)**|**Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.**|
|**2025-03-10**|**[COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07259)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO)**|**Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO .**|
|**2025-03-10**|**[HierDAMap: Towards Universal Domain Adaptive BEV Mapping via Hierarchical Perspective Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06821)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/lynn-yu/hierdamap)**|**The exploration of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) mapping technology has driven significant innovation in visual perception technology for autonomous driving. BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/HierDAMap.**|
|**2025-03-08**|**[Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/xiaohao-xu/ambiguity-in-space)**|**Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.**|

At its core, Vinci leverages EgoVideo-VL, a novel model that integrates an egocentric vision foundation model with a large language model (LLM), enabling advanced functionalities such as scene understanding, temporal grounding, video summarization, and future planning. To enhance its utility, Vinci incorporates a memory module for processing long video streams in real time while retaining contextual history, a generation module for producing visual action demonstrations, and a retrieval module that bridges egocentric and third-person perspectives to provide relevant how-to videos for skill acquisition. Unlike existing systems that often depend on specialized hardware, Vinci is hardware-agnostic, supporting deployment across a wide range of devices, including smartphones and wearable cameras. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the superior performance of EgoVideo-VL on multiple public benchmarks, showcasing its vision-language reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities. We then conduct a series of user studies to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of Vinci, highlighting its adaptability and usability in diverse scenarios. We hope Vinci can establish a new framework for portable, real-time egocentric AI systems, empowering users with contextual and actionable insights. Including the frontend, backend, and models, all codes of Vinci are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/vinci.**|
|**2025-03-04**|**[Time-Varying Coronary Artery Deformation: A Dynamic Skinning Framework for Surgical Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02218)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/ipoirot/dynamicartery)**|**Purpose: This study proposes a novel anatomically-driven dynamic modeling framework for coronary arteries using skeletal skinning weights computation, aiming to achieve precise control over vessel deformation while maintaining real-time performance for surgical simulation applications. Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

|**2025-03-03**|**[Open-source framework for detecting bias and overfitting for large pathology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01827)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/uit-hdl/feature-inspect)**|**Even foundational models that are trained on datasets with billions of data samples may develop shortcuts that lead to overfitting and bias. Shortcuts are non-relevant patterns in data, such as the background color or color intensity. So, to ensure the robustness of deep learning applications, there is a need for methods to detect and remove such shortcuts. Today's model debugging methods are time consuming since they often require customization to fit for a given model architecture in a specific domain. We propose a generalized, model-agnostic framework to debug deep learning models. We focus on the domain of histopathology, which has very large images that require large models - and therefore large computation resources. It can be run on a workstation with a commodity GPU. We demonstrate that our framework can replicate non-image shortcuts that have been found in previous work for self-supervised learning models, and we also identify possible shortcuts in a foundation model. Our easy to use tests contribute to the development of more reliable, accurate, and generalizable models for WSI analysis. Our framework is available as an open-source tool available on github.**|
|**2025-02-28**|**[SemiSAM+: Rethinking Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20749)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/yichizhang98/semisam)**|**Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically requires large amount of labeled data for training, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to high annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models.**|
|**2025-02-24**|**[RELICT: A Replica Detection Framework for Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17360)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/claim-berlin/relict)**|**Despite the potential of synthetic medical data for augmenting and improving the generalizability of deep learning models, memorization in generative models can lead to unintended leakage of sensitive patient information and limit model utility. Thus, the use of memorizing generative models in the medical domain can jeopardize patient privacy. We propose a framework for identifying replicas, i.e. nearly identical copies of the training data, in synthetic medical image datasets. Our REpLIca deteCTion (RELICT) framework for medical image generative models evaluates image similarity using three complementary approaches: (1) voxel-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis by a pretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. Two clinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated: non-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight MR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was used as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report the balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification performance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50 generated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively. Image-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a balanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use case. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not possible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.79. Replica detection is a crucial but neglected validation step for the development of generative models in medical imaging. The proposed RELICT framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for replica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical medical image synthesis.**|

Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.**|

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.**|

Existing approaches frequently rely on large annotated datasets and often struggle with the segmentation of overlapping sperm and the presence of dye impurities. To address these challenges, this paper first analyzes the issue of overlapping sperm tails from a geometric perspective and introduces a novel clustering algorithm, Con2Dis, which effectively segments overlapping tails by considering three essential factors: CONnectivity, CONformity, and DIStance. Building on this foundation, we propose an unsupervised method, SpeHeatal, designed for the comprehensive segmentation of the SPErm HEAd and TAiL. SpeHeatal employs the Segment Anything Model(SAM) to generate masks for sperm heads while filtering out dye impurities, utilizes Con2Dis to segment tails, and then applies a tailored mask splicing technique to produce complete sperm masks. Experimental results underscore the superior performance of SpeHeatal, particularly in handling images with overlapping sperm.**|

However, it remains challenging to produce perpetually realistic, view-consistent, and temporally coherent human avatars from a single image, as limited information is available in the single-view input setting. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose HumanGif, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing information. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.**|
|**2025-02-17**|**[On Quantizing Neural Representation for Variable-Rate Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11729)**|**ICLR**|**[link](https://github.com/eric-qi/neuroquant)**|**This work introduces NeuroQuant, a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) approach tailored to non-generalized Implicit Neural Representations for variable-rate Video Coding (INR-VC). Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology. The materials will be available at https://github.com/Eric-qi/NeuroQuant.**|

A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models. We make both Step-Video-T2V and Step-Video-T2V-Eval available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V. The online version can be accessed from https://yuewen.cn/videos as well. Our goal is to accelerate the innovation of video foundation models and empower video content creators.**|

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information enhancing factual and updated grounding. Recent advances in multimodal learning have led to the development of Multimodal RAG, incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges to Multimodal RAG, distinguishing it from traditional unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, metrics, benchmarks, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We precisely review training strategies, robustness enhancements, and loss functions, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and future research directions to support advancements in this evolving field. This survey lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases.

The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations. The code and the model weights are available at https://github.com/DA-Group-PKU/Magic-1-For-1.**|

However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

|**2025-02-05**|**[Diffusion-empowered AutoPrompt MedSAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06817)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/hp-ml/autopromptmedsam)**|**MedSAM, a medical foundation model derived from the SAM architecture, has demonstrated notable success across diverse medical domains. However, its clinical application faces two major challenges: the dependency on labor-intensive manual prompt generation, which imposes a significant burden on clinicians, and the absence of semantic labeling in the generated segmentation masks for organs or lesions, limiting its practicality for non-expert users. To address these limitations, we propose AutoMedSAM, an end-to-end framework derived from SAM, designed to enhance usability and segmentation performance. AutoMedSAM retains MedSAM's image encoder and mask decoder structure while introducing a novel diffusion-based class prompt encoder. The diffusion-based encoder employs a dual-decoder structure to collaboratively generate prompt embeddings guided by sparse and dense prompt definitions. These embeddings enhance the model's ability to understand and process clinical imagery autonomously. With this encoder, AutoMedSAM leverages class prompts to embed semantic information into the model's predictions, transforming MedSAM's semi-automated pipeline into a fully automated workflow. Furthermore, AutoMedSAM employs an uncertainty-aware joint optimization strategy during training to effectively inherit MedSAM's pre-trained knowledge while improving generalization by integrating multiple loss functions. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that AutoMedSAM achieves superior performance while broadening its applicability to both clinical settings and non-expert users.

However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency.

|**2025-02-06**|**[No Free Lunch in Annotation either: An objective evaluation of foundation models for streamlining annotation in animal tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03907)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/medem23/SAM-QA)**|**We analyze the capabilities of foundation models addressing the tedious task of generating annotations for animal tracking. Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.**|

Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.**|

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.**|

Unlike existing datasets, VDAct includes longer and more complex video sequences that depict a variety of event-driven activities that require advanced contextual understanding for accurate response generation. The dataset comprises 3,000 dialogues with over 30,000 question-and-answer pairs, derived from 1,000 videos with diverse activity scenarios. VDAct displays a notably challenging characteristic due to its broad spectrum of activity scenarios and wide range of question types. Empirical studies on state-of-the-art vision foundation models highlight their limitations in addressing certain question types on our dataset. Furthermore, VDEval, which integrates dialogue session history and video content summaries extracted from our supplementary Knowledge Graphs to evaluate individual responses, demonstrates a significantly higher correlation with human assessments on the VDAct dataset than existing evaluation metrics that rely solely on the context of single dialogue turns.**|

Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance.

We also introduce a highly compressive 3D autoencoder to make representations compact and further accelerate training with an ad hoc training strategy. Through this initiative, we aim to foster innovation, creativity, and inclusivity within the community of AI content creation.

XCT commonly accompanied by advanced image analysis and computer vision algorithms to extract relevant information from the images. Traditional computer vision models often struggle due to noise, resolution variability, and complex internal structures, particularly in scientific imaging applications. State-of-the-art foundational models, like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-designed for general-purpose image segmentation-have revolutionized image segmentation across various domains, yet their application in specialized fields like materials science remains under-explored. In this work, we explore the application and limitations of SAM for industrial X-ray CT inspection of additive manufacturing components. We demonstrate that while SAM shows promise, it struggles with out-of-distribution data, multiclass segmentation, and computational efficiency during fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy utilizing parameter-efficient techniques, specifically Conv-LoRa, to adapt SAM for material-specific datasets. Additionally, we leverage generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated data to enhance the training process and improve the model's segmentation performance on complex X-ray CT data. Our experimental results highlight the importance of tailored segmentation models for accurate inspection, showing that fine-tuning SAM on domain-specific scientific imaging data significantly improves performance. However, despite improvements, the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust, scalable solutions for domain-specific segmentation tasks.**|

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project simulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to provide continuous and adaptive service over time.**|

While potentially beneficial, this synthetic data generation process has been relatively underexplored in cancer histopathology. One algorithm for synthesising a realistic image is diffusion; it iteratively converts an image to noise and learns the recovery process from this noise [Wang and Vastola, 2023]. While effective, it is highly computationally expensive for high-resolution images, rendering it infeasible for histopathology. The development of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) has allowed us to learn the representation of complex high-resolution images in a latent space. A vital by-product of this is the ability to compress high-resolution images to space and recover them lossless. The marriage of diffusion and VAEs allows us to carry out diffusion in the latent space of an autoencoder, enabling us to leverage the realistic generative capabilities of diffusion while maintaining reasonable computational requirements. Rombach et al. [2021b] and Yellapragada et al. [2023] build foundational models for this task, paving the way to generate realistic histopathology images. In this paper, we discuss the pitfalls of current methods, namely [Yellapragada et al., 2023] and resolve critical errors while proposing improvements along the way. Our methods achieve an FID score of 21.11, beating its SOTA counterparts in [Yellapragada et al., 2023] by 1.2 FID, while presenting a train-time GPU memory usage reduction of 7%.**|

However, we observed that SAM struggles with certain types of objects, particularly those featuring dense, tree-like structures and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are critical for understanding its limitations in real-world use. In order to systematically examine this issue, we propose metrics to quantify two key object characteristics: tree-likeness and textural separability. Through extensive controlled synthetic experiments and testing on real datasets, we demonstrate that SAM's performance is noticeably correlated with these factors. We link these behaviors under the concept of "textural confusion", where SAM misinterprets local structure as global texture, leading to over-segmentation, or struggles to differentiate objects from similarly textured backgrounds. These findings offer the first quantitative framework to model SAM's challenges, providing valuable insights into its limitations and guiding future improvements for vision foundation models.**|

This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.**|

Methods: Using 3D CT scans with bounding box annotated nodules, we generated 3D segmentations using four techniques: Otsu, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Radiomics features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library, and multiple machine-learning-based classifiers, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN, were employed to classify nodules as cancerous or non-cancerous. The best-performing segmentation and model were further analyzed by expanding the initial nodule segmentation into the peritumoral region (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm) to understand the influence of the surrounding area on classification. Additionally, we compared our results to deep learning-based feature extractors Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers (FMCB) and other state-of-the-art baseline models. Results: Incorporating peritumoral regions significantly enhanced performance, with the best result obtained at 8 mm expansion (AUC = 0.78). Compared to image-based deep learning models, such as FMCB (AUC = 0.71) and ResNet50-SWS++ (AUC = 0.71), our radiomics-based approach demonstrated superior classification accuracy. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of peritumoral expansion in improving lung cancer classification using radiomics. These findings can inform the development of more robust AI-driven diagnostic tools.**|

Despite these advances, we find that current VLMs lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances few-shot localization performance without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored to personalized localization. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs, laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

This task encompasses several subtasks, including temporal action localization, temporal video grounding, moment retrieval, and generic event boundary detection. Existing methods in each subfield are typically designed for specific tasks and lack generalizability across domains. In this paper, we propose TimeLoc, a unified end-to-end framework for timestamp localization that can handle multiple tasks. First, our approach employs a simple yet effective one-stage localization model that supports text queries as input and multiple actions as output. Second, we jointly train the video encoder and localization model in an end-to-end manner. To efficiently process long videos, we introduce temporal chunking, enabling the handling of videos with over 30k frames.

While significant progress has been made in developing objective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to Scaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a predictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual quality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring the largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the mentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image and text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on visual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos). Leveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified model capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special improvements for handling long-text prompt alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Q-Eval-Score achieves superior performance on both visual quality and alignment, with strong generalization capabilities across other benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant value of the Q-EVAL-100K dataset. Data and codes will be available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/Q-Eval.**|

While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

The prevailing driving world model mainly build on video prediction model. Although these models can produce high-fidelity video sequences with advanced diffusion-based generator, they are constrained by their predictive duration and overall generalization capabilities. In this paper, we explore to solve this problem by combining generation loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning. In particular, we instantiate this target with three key design: (1) A more scalable Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure trained with extra mask construction task. (2) we devise diffusion-related mask tokens to deal with the fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction and generative diffusion process. (3) we extend mask construction task to spatial-temporal domain by utilizing row-wise mask for shifted self-attention rather than masked self-attention in MAE. Then, we adopt a row-wise cross-view module to align with this mask design. Based on above improvement, we propose MaskGWM: a Generalizable driving World Model embodied with Video Mask reconstruction. Our model contains two variants: MaskGWM-long, focusing on long-horizon prediction, and MaskGWM-mview, dedicated to multi-view generation. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which contain normal validation of Nuscene dataset, long-horizon rollout of OpenDV-2K dataset and zero-shot validation of Waymo dataset. Quantitative metrics on these datasets show our method notably improving state-of-the-art driving world model.**|

The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.**|

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model the temporal sequence of sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatiotemporal field from the latent state space using only a few available sensors. Our proposed algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization; beginning with an arbitrary latent state space, the dynamics of the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, the architecture produces a Koopman-SHRED model which enforces a linear latent space dynamics. We conduct a systematic experimental study including synthetic PDE data, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. With no explicit encoder, SINDy-SHRED and Koopman-SHRED enable efficient training with minimal hyperparameter tuning and laptop-level computing; further, it demonstrates robust generalization in a variety of applications with minimal to no hyperparameter adjustments.

Unlike previous methods that focus solely on integrating appearance with motion or on modeling temporal relations, our method combines both aspects by integrating them within a unified framework. MTNet is devised by effectively merging appearance and motion features during the feature extraction process within encoders, promoting a more complementary representation. To capture the intricate long-range contextual dynamics and information embedded within videos, a temporal transformer module is introduced, facilitating efficacious inter-frame interactions throughout a video clip. Furthermore, we employ a cascade of decoders all feature levels across all feature levels to optimally exploit the derived features, aiming to generate increasingly precise segmentation masks. As a result, MTNet provides a strong and compact framework that explores both temporal and cross-modality knowledge to robustly localize and track the primary object accurately in various challenging scenarios efficiently. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks conclusively show that our method not only attains state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised video object segmentation but also delivers competitive results in video salient object detection.

Existing solutions, however, often assume a single perfect matching moment, struggle with inefficient inference, and have limitations with hour-long videos. This paper introduces a flexible and scalable framework for retrieving a ranked list of moments from collection of videos in any length to match a text query, a task termed Ranked Video Moment Retrieval (RVMR). Our framework, called Segment-Proposal-Ranking (SPR), simplifies the search process into three independent stages: segment retrieval, proposal generation, and moment refinement with re-ranking. Specifically, videos are divided into equal-length segments with precomputed embeddings indexed offline, allowing efficient retrieval regardless of video length. For scalable online retrieval, both segments and queries are projected into a shared feature space to enable approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Retrieved segments are then merged into coarse-grained moment proposals. Then a refinement and re-ranking module is designed to reorder and adjust timestamps of the coarse-grained proposals. Evaluations on the TVR-Ranking dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational cost and processing time. The flexible design also allows for independent improvements to each stage, making SPR highly adaptable for large-scale applications.**|

To tackle these challenges in existing methods, we propose a decomposed per-embedding Gaussian fields (DEGSTalk), a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based talking face synthesis method for generating realistic talking faces with long hairs. Our DEGSTalk employs Deformable Pre-Embedding Gaussian Fields, which dynamically adjust pre-embedding Gaussian primitives using implicit expression coefficients. This enables precise capture of dynamic facial regions and subtle expressions. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Hair-Preserving Portrait Rendering technique to enhance the realism of long hair motions in the synthesized videos. Results show that DEGSTalk achieves improved realism and synthesis quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex facial dynamics and hair preservation. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DEGSTalk.**|

Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control. Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more accurate controllable future video generation.

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

Although existing models perform well in the factoid VideoQA task, they still face challenges in deep video understanding (DVU) task, which focuses on story videos. Compared to factoid videos, the most significant feature of story videos is storylines, which are composed of complex interactions and long-range evolvement of core story topics including characters, actions and locations. Understanding these topics requires models to possess DVU capability. However, existing DVU datasets rarely organize questions according to these story topics, making them difficult to comprehensively assess VideoQA models' DVU capability of complex storylines. Additionally, the question quantity and video length of these dataset are limited by high labor costs of handcrafted dataset building method. In this paper, we devise a large language model based multi-agent collaboration framework, StoryMind, to automatically generate a new large-scale DVU dataset. The dataset, FriendsQA, derived from the renowned sitcom Friends with an average episode length of 1,358 seconds, contains 44.6K questions evenly distributed across 14 fine-grained topics. Finally, We conduct comprehensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art VideoQA models using the FriendsQA dataset.**|

However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods leverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud sequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are typically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large memory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we propose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to compactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are generally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which consist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach builds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level separately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change, and adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content over different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of Gaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian hierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment with a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory usage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage usage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently handling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality.

While they can only generate short videos each time, existing methods achieve long video generation by iteratively calling the VGMs, using the last-frame output as the condition for the next-round generation. However, the last frame only contains short-term fine-grained information about the scene, resulting in inconsistency in the long horizon. To address this, we propose an Omni World modeL (Owl-1) to produce long-term coherent and comprehensive conditions for consistent long video generation. As videos are observations of the underlying evolving world, we propose to model the long-term developments in a latent space and use VGMs to film them into videos. Specifically, we represent the world with a latent state variable which can be decoded into explicit video observations. These observations serve as a basis for anticipating temporal dynamics which in turn update the state variable. The interaction between evolving dynamics and persistent state enhances the diversity and consistency of the long videos. Extensive experiments show that Owl-1 achieves comparable performance with SOTA methods on VBench-I2V and VBench-Long, validating its ability to generate high-quality video observations.

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project simulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to provide continuous and adaptive service over time.**|

Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune**|

Due to the limited control signals provided by sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment. However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input, which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

Despite notable advancements in the fields of video summarization and highlight detection, which can create partially usable short films from raw videos, these approaches are often domain-specific and require an in-depth understanding of real-world video content. To tackle this predicament, we propose Repurpose-10K, an extensive dataset comprising over 10,000 videos with more than 120,000 annotated clips aimed at resolving the video long-to-short task. Recognizing the inherent constraints posed by untrained human annotators, which can result in inaccurate annotations for repurposed videos, we propose a two-stage solution to obtain annotations from real-world user-generated content. Furthermore, we offer a baseline model to address this challenging task by integrating audio, visual, and caption aspects through a cross-modal fusion and alignment framework. We aspire for our work to ignite groundbreaking research in the lesser-explored realms of video repurposing.**|

However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.**|

Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's efficient similarity search. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$ -Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

We propose a novel framework for training iterative skeletonization algorithms with a learnable component. The framework leverages synthetic data, task-specific augmentation, and a model distillation strategy to learn compact neural networks that produce thin, connected skeletons with a fully differentiable iterative algorithm.   Our method demonstrates a 100 times speedup over topology-constrained algorithms while maintaining high accuracy and generalizing effectively to new domains without fine-tuning.

However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research.

However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72 $\times$ on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality.

This task encompasses several subtasks, including temporal action localization, temporal video grounding, moment retrieval, and generic event boundary detection. Existing methods in each subfield are typically designed for specific tasks and lack generalizability across domains. In this paper, we propose TimeLoc, a unified end-to-end framework for timestamp localization that can handle multiple tasks. First, our approach employs a simple yet effective one-stage localization model that supports text queries as input and multiple actions as output. Second, we jointly train the video encoder and localization model in an end-to-end manner. To efficiently process long videos, we introduce temporal chunking, enabling the handling of videos with over 30k frames. Third, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained text encoders with a multi-stage training strategy further enhances text-conditioned localization. TimeLoc achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks: +1.3% and +1.9% mAP over previous best methods on THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens-100, +1.1% on Kinetics-GEBD, +2.94% mAP on QVHighlights, and significant improvements in temporal video grounding (+11.5% on TACoS and +6.7% on Charades-STA under R1@0.5).

While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.**|

Traditional latent diffusion pipelines rely on large Variational Autoencoder decoders that can slow down generation and consume considerable GPU memory. We propose custom-trained decoders using lightweight Vision Transformer and Taming Transformer architectures. Experiments show up to 15% overall speed-ups for image generation on COCO2017 and up to 20 times faster decoding in the sub-module, with additional gains on UCF-101 for video tasks. Memory requirements are moderately reduced, and while there is a small drop in perceptual quality compared to the default decoder, the improvements in speed and scalability are crucial for large-scale inference scenarios such as generating 100K images. Our work is further contextualized by advances in efficient video generation, including dual masking strategies, illustrating a broader effort to improve the scalability and efficiency of generative models.**|

Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the evaluation and follow-up of these tumours, allowing specialists to analyse their morphology. However, existing methods for automatic glioma segmentation often lack generalization capability across other brain tumour domains, require extensive computational resources, or fail to fully utilize the multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) data used to delineate them. In this work, we introduce GBT-SAM, a novel Generalizable Brain Tumour (GBT) framework that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to brain tumour segmentation tasks. Our method employs a two-step training protocol: first, fine-tuning the patch embedding layer to process the entire mp-MRI modalities, and second, incorporating parameter-efficient LoRA blocks and a Depth-Condition block into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture inter-slice correlations. GBT-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adult Glioma dataset (Dice Score of $93.54$ ) while demonstrating robust generalization across Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. Furthermore, GBT-SAM uses less than 6.5M trainable parameters, thus offering an efficient solution for brain tumour segmentation. \\ Our code and models are available at https://github.com/vpulab/med-sam-brain .**|

Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR), including the inner whiter matter (WM) and outer pial surfaces, is one of the key tasks in dMRI analyses such as fiber tractography and multimodal MRI analysis. Existing CSR methods rely on anatomical T1-weighted data and map them into the dMRI space through inter-modality registration. However, due to the low resolution and image distortions of dMRI data, inter-modality registration faces significant challenges. This work proposes a novel end-to-end learning framework, DDCSR, which for the first time enables CSR directly from dMRI data. DDCSR consists of two major components, including: (1) an implicit learning module to predict a voxel-wise intermediate surface representation, and (2) an explicit learning module to predict the 3D mesh surfaces. Compared to several baseline and advanced CSR methods, we show that the proposed DDCSR can largely increase both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high generalization ability of DDCSR to data from different sources, despite the differences in dMRI acquisitions and populations.**|

Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.**|

Over time, retrieval techniques have evolved from Unimodal Retrieval (UR) to Cross-modal Retrieval (CR) and, more recently, to Composed Multi-modal Retrieval (CMR). CMR enables users to retrieve images or videos by integrating a reference visual input with textual modifications, enhancing search flexibility and precision. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CMR, covering its fundamental challenges, technical advancements, and categorization into supervised, zero-shot, and semi-supervised learning paradigms.

To circumvent these issues while preserving diagnostic accuracy, we propose a novel Transformer with Localization Prompts (TLP) framework for synthesizing CE-MRI from non-contrast MR images. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: a hierarchical backbone that uses efficient Transformer to process multi-scale features; a multi-stage fusion system consisting of Local and Global Fusion modules that hierarchically integrate complementary information via spatial attention operations and cross-attention mechanisms, respectively; and a Fuzzy Prompt Generation (FPG) module that enhances the TLP model's generalization by emulating radiologists' manual annotation through stochastic feature perturbation. The framework uniquely enables interactive clinical integration by allowing radiologists to input diagnostic prompts during inference, synergizing artificial intelligence with medical expertise. This research establishes a new paradigm for contrast-free MRI synthesis while addressing critical clinical needs for safer diagnostic procedures.

However, existing egocentric video representation learning methods mainly focus on aligning video representation with high-level narrations, overlooking the intricate dynamics between hands and objects. In this work, we aim to integrate the modeling of fine-grained hand-object dynamics into the video representation learning process. Since no suitable data is available, we introduce HOD, a novel pipeline employing a hand-object detector and a large language model to generate high-quality narrations with detailed descriptions of hand-object dynamics. To learn these fine-grained dynamics, we propose EgoVideo, a model with a new lightweight motion adapter to capture fine-grained hand-object motion information. Through our co-training strategy, EgoVideo effectively and efficiently leverages the fine-grained hand-object dynamics in the HOD data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric downstream tasks, including improvements of 6.3% in EK-100 multi-instance retrieval, 5.7% in EK-100 classification, and 16.3% in EGTEA classification in zero-shot settings.

While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving from the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero variance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this process, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However, standard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space. This inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading to high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this limitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a geodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise scheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian prior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion models. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and using as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated GDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared to DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than DDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM. These efficiency gains enable rapid model exploration and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/GDM-VE.**|

However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.**|

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models.**|

However, the existing trajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion trajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions between the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation, we propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video generation, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some objects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the dynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion control of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception module and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object perception module employs visual language models to capture the position and category information of various objects within the image. The Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input and conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for each of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model for video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction (VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video generation methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of interactions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used for accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag achieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object motion control.

Traditional workflows follow a sequential pipeline-brain extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation, and classification-treating each step as an independent task. These methods rely heavily on task-specific training data and expert intervention to correct intermediate errors, making them particularly burdensome for high-dimensional neuroimaging data, where annotations and quality control are costly and time-consuming. We introduce UniBrain, a unified end-to-end framework that integrates all processing steps into a single optimization process, allowing tasks to interact and refine each other. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive task-specific annotations, UniBrain operates with minimal supervision, leveraging only low-cost labels (i.e., classification and extraction) and a single labeled atlas. By jointly optimizing extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation, and classification, UniBrain enhances both accuracy and computational efficiency while significantly reducing annotation effort. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods across multiple tasks, offering a more scalable and reliable solution for neuroimaging analysis.

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints. However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications. In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge. We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size. Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns. Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset. Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience.

This constraint imposes high retraining or fine-tuning costs, especially for imitation learning-based approaches, when adapting to new end-effectors. To mitigate this issue, we present a diffusion-based policy with a hybrid learning-optimization framework, enabling zero-shot adaptation to novel grippers without additional data collection for retraining policy. During training, the policy learns manipulation primitives from demonstrations collected using a base gripper. At inference, a diffusion-based optimization strategy dynamically enforces kinematic and safety constraints, ensuring that generated trajectories align with the physical properties of unseen grippers. This is achieved through a constrained denoising procedure that adapts trajectories to gripper-specific parameters (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) while preserving collision avoidance and task feasibility. We validate our method on a Franka Panda robot across six gripper configurations, including 3D-printed fingertips, flexible silicone gripper, and Robotiq 2F-85 gripper. Our approach achieves a 93.3% average task success rate across grippers (vs. 23.3-26.7% for diffusion policy baselines), supporting tool-center-point variations of 16-23.5 cm and jaw widths of 7.5-11.5 cm. The results demonstrate that constrained diffusion enables robust cross-gripper manipulation while maintaining the sample efficiency of imitation learning, eliminating the need for gripper-specific retraining.

However, the development of VLMs for surgical VQA is challenging due to limited datasets and the risk of overfitting and catastrophic forgetting during full fine-tuning of pretrained weights. While parameter-efficient techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Matrix of Rank Adaptation (MoRA) address adaptation challenges, their uniform parameter distribution overlooks the feature hierarchy in deep networks, where earlier layers, that learn general features, require more parameters than later ones. This work introduces PitVQA++ with an open-ended PitVQA dataset and vector matrix-low-rank adaptation (Vector-MoLoRA), an innovative VLM fine-tuning approach for adapting GPT-2 to pituitary surgery. Open-Ended PitVQA comprises around 101,803 frames from 25 procedural videos with 745,972 question-answer sentence pairs, covering key surgical elements such as phase and step recognition, context understanding, tool detection, localization, and interactions recognition. Vector-MoLoRA incorporates the principles of LoRA and MoRA to develop a matrix-low-rank adaptation strategy that employs vector ranking to allocate more parameters to earlier layers, gradually reducing them in the later layers. Our approach, validated on the Open-Ended PitVQA and EndoVis18-VQA datasets, effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while significantly enhancing performance over recent baselines. Furthermore, our risk-coverage analysis highlights its enhanced reliability and trustworthiness in handling uncertain predictions.

Since the event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that only encode brightness changes with a micro-second temporal resolution, several works utilized the event camera to enhance the performance of VFI. However, existing methods estimate bidirectional inter-frame motion fields with only events or approximations, which can not consider the complex motion in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based VFI framework with cross-modal asymmetric bidirectional motion field estimation. In detail, our EIF-BiOFNet utilizes each valuable characteristic of the events and images for direct estimation of inter-frame motion fields without any approximation methods. Moreover, we develop an interactive attention-based frame synthesis network to efficiently leverage the complementary warping-based and synthesis-based features. Finally, we build a large-scale event-based VFI dataset, ERF-X170FPS, with a high frame rate, extreme motion, and dynamic textures to overcome the limitations of previous event-based VFI datasets. Extensive experimental results validate that our method shows significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art VFI methods on various datasets.

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/LaM-SLidE .**|

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

Therefore, automatically identifying team communication in the OR is crucial for patient safety and advances in the development of computer-assisted surgical workflow analysis and intra-operative support systems. To take the first step, we propose a new task of detecting communication briefings involving all OR team members, i.e. the team Time-out and the StOP?-protocol, by localizing their start and end times in video recordings of surgical operations. Methods: We generate an OR dataset of real surgeries, called Team-OR, with more than one hundred hours of surgical videos captured by the multi-view camera system in the OR. The dataset contains temporal annotations of 33 Time-out and 22 StOP?-protocol activities in total. We then propose a novel group activity detection approach, where we encode both scene context and action features, and use an efficient neural network model to output the results. Results: The experimental results on the Team-OR dataset show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art temporal action detection approaches. It also demonstrates the lack of research on group activities in the OR, proving the significance of our dataset. Conclusion: We investigate the Team Time-Out and the StOP?-protocol in the OR, by presenting the first OR dataset with temporal annotations of group activities protocols, and introducing a novel group activity detection approach that outperforms existing approaches.

The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3 $\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.**|

Biological selective attention mechanisms allow agents to focus on salient Regions of Interest (ROIs), reducing computational demand while maintaining real-time responsiveness. Event-based cameras, inspired by the mammalian retina, enhance this capability by capturing asynchronous scene changes enabling efficient low-latency processing. To distinguish moving objects while the event-based camera is in motion the agent requires an object motion segmentation mechanism to accurately detect targets and center them in the visual field (fovea). Integrating event-based sensors with neuromorphic algorithms represents a paradigm shift, using Spiking Neural Networks to parallelize computation and adapt to dynamic environments. This work presents a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network bioinspired attention system for selective attention through object motion sensitivity. The system generates events via fixational eye movements using a Dynamic Vision Sensor integrated into the Speck neuromorphic hardware, mounted on a Pan-Tilt unit, to identify the ROI and saccade toward it. The system, characterized using ideal gratings and benchmarked against the Event Camera Motion Segmentation Dataset, reaches a mean IoU of 82.2% and a mean SSIM of 96% in multi-object motion segmentation. The detection of salient objects reaches 88.8% accuracy in office scenarios and 89.8% in low-light conditions on the Event-Assisted Low-Light Video Object Segmentation Dataset. A real-time demonstrator shows the system's 0.12 s response to dynamic scenes.

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.**|

We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification.

Building on Open-Sora, On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach.

These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices, expanding accessibility, ensuring user privacy, reducing dependence on cloud infrastructure, and lowering associated costs. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation capabilities on commodity mobile and embedded devices.

This paper introduces imitation learning with latent video planning (VILP). We propose a latent video diffusion model to generate predictive robot videos that adhere to temporal consistency to a good degree. Our method is able to generate highly time-aligned videos from multiple views, which is crucial for robot policy learning. Our video generation model is highly time-efficient. For example, it can generate videos from two distinct perspectives, each consisting of six frames with a resolution of 96x160 pixels, at a rate of 5 Hz. In the experiments, we demonstrate that VILP outperforms the existing video generation robot policy across several metrics: training costs, inference speed, temporal consistency of generated videos, and the performance of the policy. We also compared our method with other imitation learning methods. Our findings indicate that VILP can rely less on extensive high-quality task-specific robot action data while still maintaining robust performance. In addition, VILP possesses robust capabilities in representing multi-modal action distributions. Our paper provides a practical example of how to effectively integrate video generation models into robot policies, potentially offering insights for related fields and directions.

Current deep learning methods for cloud segmentation suffer from three issues. (a) Constrain on their receptive field due to the fixed size of the convolution kernel. (b) Lack of robustness towards different scenarios. (c) Requirement of a large number of parameters and limitations for real-time implementation. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Dynamic U-Net (DDUNet) for supervised cloud segmentation. The DDUNet adheres to a U-Net architecture and integrates two crucial modules: the dynamic multi-scale convolution (DMSC), improving merging features under different reception fields, and the dynamic weights and bias generator (DWBG) in classification layers to enhance generalization ability. More importantly, owing to the use of depth-wise convolution, the DDUNet is a lightweight network that can achieve 95.3% accuracy on the SWINySEG dataset with only 0.33M parameters, and achieve superior performance over three different configurations of the SWINySEg dataset in both accuracy and efficiency.**|

Accurate reconstruction of high-resolution volumes is complicated by the very low signal-to-noise ratio and a restricted range of sample tilts, creating a missing wedge of Fourier information. Recent self-supervised deep learning approaches, which post-process initial reconstructions done by filtered backprojection (FBP), have significantly improved reconstruction quality, but they are computationally expensive, demand large memory, and require retraining for each new dataset. End-to-end supervised learning is an appealing alternative but is impeded by the lack of ground truth and the large memory demands of high-resolution volumetric data. Training on synthetic data often leads to overfitting and poor generalization to real data, and, to date, no general end-to-end deep learning reconstructors exist for cryo-ET. In this work, we introduce CryoLithe, a local, memory-efficient reconstruction network that directly estimates the volume from an aligned tilt-series, overcoming the suboptimal FBP. We demonstrate that leveraging transform-domain locality makes our network robust to distribution shifts, enabling effective supervised training and giving excellent results on real data -- without retraining or fine-tuning.**|

In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model the temporal sequence of sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatiotemporal field from the latent state space using only a few available sensors. Our proposed algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization; beginning with an arbitrary latent state space, the dynamics of the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, the architecture produces a Koopman-SHRED model which enforces a linear latent space dynamics. We conduct a systematic experimental study including synthetic PDE data, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. With no explicit encoder, SINDy-SHRED and Koopman-SHRED enable efficient training with minimal hyperparameter tuning and laptop-level computing; further, it demonstrates robust generalization in a variety of applications with minimal to no hyperparameter adjustments. Finally, the interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enables accurate long-term video predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming all baseline methods considered, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.**|

Modern Koreans and Chinese cannot understand Korean historical documents without substantial additional help, and while previous efforts have produced some Korean and English translations, this requires in-depth expertise, and so most of the documents are not translated into any modern language. To address this gap, we present HERITAGE, the first open-source Hanja NLP toolkit to assist in understanding and translating the unexplored Korean historical documents written in Hanja. HERITAGE is a web-based platform providing model predictions of three critical tasks in historical document understanding via Hanja language models: punctuation restoration, named entity recognition, and machine translation (MT). HERITAGE also provides an interactive glossary, which provides the character-level reading of the Hanja characters in modern Korean, as well as character-level English definition. HERITAGE serves two purposes. First, anyone interested in these documents can get a general understanding from the model predictions and the interactive glossary, especially MT outputs in Korean and English. Second, since the model outputs are not perfect, Hanja experts can revise them to produce better annotations and translations. This would boost the translation efficiency and potentially lead to most of the historical documents being translated into modern languages, lowering the barrier on unexplored Korean historical documents.**|

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.**|

This problem is exacerbated when there is not just one output label, but a set of them. This is the case for multilabel learning (MLL) algorithms used to classify patterns, rank labels, or learn the distribution of outputs. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature. The one that can be applied universally, independent of the algorithm used to build the model, is data resampling. The generation of new instances associated with minority labels, so that empty areas of the feature space are filled, helps to improve the obtained models. The quality of these new instances depends on the algorithm used to generate them. In this paper, a diffusion model tailored to produce new instances for MLL data, called MLDM (\textit{MultiLabel Diffusion Model}), is proposed. Diffusion models have been mainly used to generate artificial images and videos. Our proposed MLDM is based on this type of models. The experiments conducted compare MLDM with several other MLL resampling algorithms. The results show that MLDM is competitive while it improves efficiency.**|

However, these approaches often encounter blurring and temporal inconsistencies when dealing with large masks, highlighting the need for models with enhanced generative capabilities. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a prominent technique in image and video generation due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we introduce DiffuEraser, a video inpainting model based on stable diffusion, designed to fill masked regions with greater details and more coherent structures. We incorporate prior information to provide initialization and weak conditioning,which helps mitigate noisy artifacts and suppress hallucinations. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency during long-sequence inference, we expand the temporal receptive fields of both the prior model and DiffuEraser, and further enhance consistency by leveraging the temporal smoothing property of Video Diffusion Models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both content completeness and temporal consistency while maintaining acceptable efficiency.**|

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.**|

Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/**|

Existing methods predominantly rely on 3D bounding boxes and BEV road maps for foreground and background control, which fail to capture the full complexity of driving scenes and adequately integrate multimodal information. In this work, we present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences. Specifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional input, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial geometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the synthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant ones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function. Additionally, we develop the Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism to dynamically prioritize relevant information and suppress noise, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Finally, to ensure high-quality image-to-video generation, we introduce the Reward-Guided Diffusion (RGD) framework, which maintains global consistency and semantic coherence in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets. On the NuScenes dataset, DualDiff reduces the FID score by 4.09% compared to the best baseline. In downstream tasks, such as BEV segmentation, our method improves vehicle mIoU by 4.50% and road mIoU by 1.70%, while in BEV 3D object detection, the foreground mAP increases by 1.46%.

Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.**|

Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

|**2025-03-03**|**[One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects in Egocentric Organizing Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01092)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/dikay1/os-agdo)**|**Deformable object manipulation in robotics presents significant challenges due to uncertainties in component properties, diverse configurations, visual interference, and ambiguous prompts. These factors complicate both perception and control tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects (OS-AGDO) in egocentric organizing scenes, enabling robots to recognize previously unseen deformable objects with varying colors and shapes using minimal samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Deformable Object Semantic Enhancement Module (DefoSEM), which enhances hierarchical understanding of the internal structure and improves the ability to accurately identify local features, even under conditions of weak component information. Next, we propose the ORB-Enhanced Keypoint Fusion Module (OEKFM), which optimizes feature extraction of key components by leveraging geometric constraints and improves adaptability to diversity and visual interference. Additionally, we propose an instance-conditional prompt based on image data and task context, effectively mitigates the issue of region ambiguity caused by prompt words. To validate these methods, we construct a diverse real-world dataset, AGDDO15, which includes 15 common types of deformable objects and their associated organizational actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 6.2%, 3.2%, and 2.9% in KLD, SIM, and NSS metrics, respectively, while exhibiting high generalization performance. Source code and benchmark dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Dikay1/OS-AGDO.**|

The key challenge of this task lies in simultaneously generating natural motions while preserving the original appearance of the images. However, current I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs) often produce videos with limited motion degrees or exhibit uncontrollable motion that conflicts with the textual condition. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model merging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time. Specifically, our framework consists of three separate stages: (1) Starting with a base I2V-DM, we explicitly inject the textual condition into the temporal module using a lightweight, learnable adapter and fine-tune the integrated model to improve motion controllability. (2) We introduce a training-free extrapolation strategy to amplify the dynamic range of the motion, effectively reversing the fine-tuning process to enhance the motion degree significantly. (3) With the above two-stage models excelling in motion controllability and degree, we decouple the relevant parameters associated with each type of motion ability and inject them into the base I2V-DM. Since the I2V-DM handles different levels of motion controllability and dynamics at various denoising time steps, we adjust the motion-aware parameters accordingly over time. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods.**|

To address this, synthetic lesion generation has become a promising approach. However, existing models struggle with scalability, fine-grained control over lesion attributes, and the generation of complex structures. We propose LesionDiffusion, a text-controllable lesion synthesis framework for 3D CT imaging that generates both lesions and corresponding masks. By utilizing a structured lesion report template, our model provides greater control over lesion attributes and supports a wider variety of lesion types. We introduce a dataset of 1,505 annotated CT scans with paired lesion masks and structured reports, covering 14 lesion types across 8 organs. LesionDiffusion consists of two components: a lesion mask synthesis network (LMNet) and a lesion inpainting network (LINet), both guided by lesion attributes and image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LesionDiffusion significantly improves segmentation performance, with strong generalization to unseen lesion types and organs, outperforming current state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we propose an unpaired low-light image enhancement network leveraging novel controlled transformation-based self-supervision and unpaired self-conditioning strategies. The model determines the required degrees of enhancement at the input image pixels, which are learned from the unpaired low-lit and well-lit images without any direct supervision. The self-supervision is based on a controlled transformation of the input image and subsequent maintenance of its enhancement in spite of the transformation. The self-conditioning performs training of the model on unpaired images such that it does not enhance an already-enhanced image or a well-lit input image. The inherent noise in the input low-light images is handled by employing low gradient magnitude suppression in a detail-preserving manner. In addition, our noise handling is self-conditioned by preventing the denoising of noise-free well-lit images. The training based on low-light image enhancement-specific attributes allows our model to avoid paired supervision without compromising significantly in performance. While our proposed self-supervision aids consistent enhancement, our novel self-conditioning facilitates adequate enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that our model, in general, outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and subjectively. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of our self-supervision and self-conditioning strategies, and the related loss functions.**|

While current deep generative models can produce high-resolution anatomically accurate templates for population-wide studies, their ability to predict future aging trajectories for individuals remains limited, particularly in capturing subject-specific neuroanatomical variations over time. In this study, we introduce Individualized Brain Synthesis (InBrainSyn), a framework for synthesizing high-resolution subject-specific longitudinal MRI scans that simulate neurodegeneration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging. InBrainSyn uses a parallel transport algorithm to adapt the population-level aging trajectories learned by a generative deep template network, enabling individualized aging synthesis. As InBrainSyn uses diffeomorphic transformations to simulate aging, the synthesized images are topologically consistent with the original anatomy by design. We evaluated InBrainSyn both quantitatively and qualitatively on AD and healthy control cohorts from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies - version 3 dataset. Experimentally, InBrainSyn can also model neuroanatomical transitions between normal aging and AD. An evaluation of an external set supports its generalizability. Overall, with only a single baseline scan, InBrainSyn synthesizes realistic 3D spatiotemporal T1w MRI scans, producing personalized longitudinal aging trajectories. The code for InBrainSyn is available at: https://github.com/Fjr9516/InBrainSyn.**|

Existing portrait animation methods fail to achieve relightable portraits because they do not separate and manipulate intrinsic (identity and appearance) and extrinsic (pose and lighting) features. In this paper, we present a Lighting Controllable Video Diffusion model (LCVD) for high-fidelity, relightable portrait animation. We address this limitation by distinguishing these feature types through dedicated subspaces within the feature space of a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, we employ the 3D mesh, pose, and lighting-rendered shading hints of the portrait to represent the extrinsic attributes, while the reference represents the intrinsic attributes. In the training phase, we employ a reference adapter to map the reference into the intrinsic feature subspace and a shading adapter to map the shading hints into the extrinsic feature subspace. By merging features from these subspaces, the model achieves nuanced control over lighting, pose, and expression in generated animations. Extensive evaluations show that LCVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lighting realism, image quality, and video consistency, setting a new benchmark in relightable portrait animation.**|

However, the existing trajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion trajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions between the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation, we propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video generation, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some objects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the dynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion control of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception module and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object perception module employs visual language models to capture the position and category information of various objects within the image. The Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input and conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for each of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model for video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction (VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video generation methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of interactions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used for accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag achieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object motion control. Our benchmark, codes, and models will be available at https://github.com/WesLee88524/C-Drag-Official-Repo.**|

This issue is particularly pronounced when manipulating meter-scale objects or those with varying stiffness, as traditional gripping techniques and strategies frequently prove inadequate. In this letter, we introduce a novel surface-based multi-module robotic manipulation framework that utilizes a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based motion generator, combined with a simulation-based optimization method to determine the optimal manipulation parameters for a multi-module origami robotic surface (Ori-Pixel). This approach allows for the manipulation of objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, with varying stiffness and shape. The optimized CPG parameters are tested through both dynamic simulations and a series of prototype experiments involving a wide range of objects differing in size, weight, shape, and material, demonstrating robust manipulation capabilities.**|

Traditional workflows follow a sequential pipeline-brain extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation, and classification-treating each step as an independent task. These methods rely heavily on task-specific training data and expert intervention to correct intermediate errors, making them particularly burdensome for high-dimensional neuroimaging data, where annotations and quality control are costly and time-consuming. We introduce UniBrain, a unified end-to-end framework that integrates all processing steps into a single optimization process, allowing tasks to interact and refine each other. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive task-specific annotations, UniBrain operates with minimal supervision, leveraging only low-cost labels (i.e., classification and extraction) and a single labeled atlas. By jointly optimizing extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation, and classification, UniBrain enhances both accuracy and computational efficiency while significantly reducing annotation effort. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods across multiple tasks, offering a more scalable and reliable solution for neuroimaging analysis.

Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in qualitative and quantitative benchmarks, allowing high-resolution realistic image synthesis from rough hand-drawn sketches.**|

However, acquiring such datasets is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. To address these limitations, the use of synthetic data has gained attention as a viable alternative, allowing researchers to generate vast amounts of data while simulating various environmental contexts in a controlled setting. In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications. This study sets the stage for the creation of large-scale synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future research and development.**|

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust Re-ID systems capable of handling long-term scenarios, where persons' appearances can change significantly due to variations in clothing and physical characteristics. In this paper, we present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset specifically designed for long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA consists of recordings from strategically placed cameras over a seven-month period, capturing significant variations in both temporal and appearance attributes, including controlled changes in participants' clothing and physical features. The dataset includes 22 individuals, four connected indoor environments, and seven cameras. We collected more than five hours of video that we semi-automatically labeled to generate around one million bounding boxes with identity annotations. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios.**|

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.**|

Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode.

However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video animation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand-drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridging the divide between ordinary users and professional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to automatically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of generated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames.

Planning these footsteps online is challenging given non-convexity of the safe terrain, and imperfect perception and state estimation. This paper addresses these challenges with a full-stack perception and control system for achieving underactuated walking on discontinuous terrain. First, we develop model-predictive footstep control (MPFC), a single mixed-integer quadratic program which assumes a convex polygon terrain decomposition to optimize over discrete foothold choice, footstep position, ankle torque, template dynamics, and footstep timing at over 100 Hz. We then propose a novel approach for generating convex polygon terrain decompositions online. Our perception stack decouples safe-terrain classification from fitting planar polygons, generating a temporally consistent terrain segmentation in real time using a single CPU thread. We demonstrate the performance of our perception and control stack through outdoor experiments with the underactuated biped Cassie, achieving state of the art perceptive bipedal walking on discontinuous terrain.

However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/hurunyi/VideoShield.**|

Building on prior approaches centered on human pose control, X-Dyna addresses key shortcomings causing the loss of dynamic details, enhancing the lifelike qualities of human video animations. At the core of our approach is the Dynamics-Adapter, a lightweight module that effectively integrates reference appearance context into the spatial attentions of the diffusion backbone while preserving the capacity of motion modules in synthesizing fluid and intricate dynamic details. Beyond body pose control, we connect a local control module with our model to capture identity-disentangled facial expressions, facilitating accurate expression transfer for enhanced realism in animated scenes. Together, these components form a unified framework capable of learning physical human motion and natural scene dynamics from a diverse blend of human and scene videos. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X-Dyna outperforms state-of-the-art methods, creating highly lifelike and expressive animations.

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

Existing methods construct such supervision signals from videos, as they capture how objects change with various physical interactions. However, these models are usually built upon text-to-image diffusion models, so necessitate (i) massive training samples and (ii) an additional reference encoder to learn real-world dynamics and visual consistency. In this paper, we reformulate this task as an image-to-video generation problem, so that inherit powerful video diffusion priors to reduce training costs and ensure temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce FramePainter as an efficient instantiation of this formulation. Initialized with Stable Video Diffusion, it only uses a lightweight sparse control encoder to inject editing signals. Considering the limitations of temporal attention in handling large motion between two frames, we further propose matching attention to enlarge the receptive field while encouraging dense correspondence between edited and source image tokens. We highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of FramePainter across various of editing signals: it domainantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with far less training data, achieving highly seamless and coherent editing of images, \eg, automatically adjust the reflection of the cup. Moreover, FramePainter also exhibits exceptional generalization in scenarios not present in real-world videos, \eg, transform the clownfish into shark-like shape.

|**2025-01-16**|**[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/fk-diffusion-steering)**|**Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.**|

Generally, our method consists of three primary modules: (\textbf{i}) a facial extractor that captures versatile and precise facial features for each human ID from both global and local perspectives; (\textbf{ii}) a multi-scale projector that maps face embeddings into the contextual space of image query in video diffusion transformers; (\textbf{iii}) an ID router that dynamically combines and allocates multiple ID embedding to the corresponding space-time regions. Leveraging a meticulously curated text-video dataset and a multi-stage training protocol, \texttt{Ingredients} demonstrates superior performance in turning custom photos into dynamic and personalized video content.

Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control. Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more accurate controllable future video generation.

While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.**|

Recent advances based on diffusion models typically rely on separate networks for reference appearance feature extraction and target visual generation, leading to inconsistent domain gaps between references and targets. In this paper, we frame the task as a spatially-conditioned inpainting problem, where the target image is inpainted to maintain appearance consistency with the reference. This approach enables the reference features to guide the generation of pose-compliant targets within a unified denoising network, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Additionally, to better maintain the reference appearance information, we impose a causal feature interaction framework, in which reference features can only query from themselves, while target features can query appearance information from both the reference and the target. To further enhance computational efficiency and flexibility, in practical implementation, we decompose the spatially-conditioned generation process into two stages: reference appearance extraction and conditioned target generation. Both stages share a single denoising network, with interactions restricted to self-attention layers. This proposed method ensures flexible control over the appearance of generated human images and videos. By fine-tuning existing base diffusion models on human video data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to unseen human identities and poses without requiring additional per-instance fine-tuning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing competitive performance compared to existing methods for consistent human image and video synthesis.**|

Existing G2P methods typically treat sign poses as discrete three-dimensional coordinates and directly fit them, which overlooks the relative positional relationships among joints. To this end, we provide a new perspective, constraining joint associations and gesture details by modeling the limb bones to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated poses. In this work, we propose a pioneering iconicity disentangled diffusion framework, termed Sign-IDD, specifically designed for SLP. Sign-IDD incorporates a novel Iconicity Disentanglement (ID) module to bridge the gap between relative positions among joints. The ID module disentangles the conventional 3D joint representation into a 4D bone representation, comprising the 3D spatial direction vector and 1D spatial distance vector between adjacent joints. Additionally, an Attribute Controllable Diffusion (ACD) module is introduced to further constrain joint associations, in which the attribute separation layer aims to separate the bone direction and length attributes, and the attribute control layer is designed to guide the pose generation by leveraging the above attributes. The ACD module utilizes the gloss embeddings as semantic conditions and finally generates sign poses from noise embeddings. Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and USTC-CSL datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/NaVi-start/Sign-IDD.**|

Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's efficient similarity search. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research.

However, the current video-based dialogue systems are limited by their reliance on a single dialogue type, which hinders their versatility in practical applications across a range of scenarios, including question-answering, emotional dialog, etc. In this paper, we identify this challenge as how to generate video-driven multilingual mixed-type dialogues. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel task and create a human-to-human video-driven multilingual mixed-type dialogue corpus, termed KwaiChat, containing a total of 93,209 videos and 246,080 dialogues, across 4 dialogue types, 30 domains, 4 languages, and 13 topics. Additionally, we establish baseline models on KwaiChat. An extensive analysis of 7 distinct LLMs on KwaiChat reveals that GPT-4o achieves the best performance but still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning and fine-tuning, which indicates that the task is not trivial and needs further research.**|

While significant progress has been made in developing objective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to Scaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a predictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual quality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring the largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the mentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image and text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on visual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos). Leveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified model capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special improvements for handling long-text prompt alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Q-Eval-Score achieves superior performance on both visual quality and alignment, with strong generalization capabilities across other benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant value of the Q-EVAL-100K dataset. Data and codes will be available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/Q-Eval.**|

An automatic multi-label classifier of diseases in CXR images can benefit by incorporating aspects of the radiologists' approach. Recorded visual scanpaths of radiologists on CXR images can be used for the said purpose. But, such scanpaths are not available for most CXR images, which creates a gap even for modern deep learning based classifiers. This paper proposes to mitigate this gap by generating effective artificial visual scanpaths using a visual scanpath prediction model for CXR images. Further, a multi-class multi-label classifier framework is proposed that uses a generated scanpath and visual image features to classify diseases in CXR images. While the scanpath predictor is based on a recurrent neural network, the multi-label classifier involves a novel iterative sequential model with an attention module. We show that our scanpath predictor generates human-like visual scanpaths. We also demonstrate that the use of artificial visual scanpaths improves multi-class multi-label disease classification results on CXR images. The above observations are made from experiments involving around 0.2 million CXR images from 2 widely-used datasets considering the multi-label classification of 14 pathological findings.

Existing affordance-based methods primarily predict coarse interaction regions and cannot directly constrain the grasping posture, leading to a disconnection between visual perception and manipulation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-keypoint affordance representation for functional dexterous grasping, which directly encodes task-driven grasp configurations by localizing functional contact points. Our method introduces Contact-guided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA), leveraging human grasping experience images for weak supervision combined with Large Vision Models for fine affordance feature extraction, achieving generalization while avoiding manual keypoint annotations. Additionally, we present a Keypoint-based Grasp matrix Transformation (KGT) method, ensuring spatial consistency between hand keypoints and object contact points, thus providing a direct link between visual perception and dexterous grasping actions. Experiments on public real-world FAH datasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance localization accuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization to unseen tools and tasks, bridging the gap between visual affordance learning and dexterous robotic manipulation. The source code and demo videos will be publicly available at https://github.com/PopeyePxx/MKA.**|

Traditional VR-VQA methods trained on static datasets with limited distortion diversity struggle to balance correlation and precision. This becomes particularly critical when generalizing to diverse VR content and continually adapting to dynamic and evolving video distribution variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for assessing the perceptual quality of VR videos, Adaptive Score Alignment Learning (ASAL). ASAL integrates correlation loss with error loss to enhance alignment with human subjective ratings and precision in predicting perceptual quality. In particular, ASAL can naturally adapt to continually changing distributions through a feature space smoothing process that enhances generalization to unseen content. To further improve continual adaptation to dynamic VR environments, we extend ASAL with adaptive memory replay as a novel Continul Learning (CL) framework. Unlike traditional CL models, ASAL utilizes key frame extraction and feature adaptation to address the unique challenges of non-stationary variations with both the computation and storage restrictions of VR devices. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for VR-VQA and its CL counterpart, introducing new data splits and evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAL outperforms recent strong baseline models, achieving overall correlation gains of up to 4.78\% in the static joint training setting and 12.19\% in the dynamic CL setting on various datasets. This validates the effectiveness of ASAL in addressing the inherent challenges of VR-VQA.Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/ASAL_CVQA.**|

Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting a weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses image captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1) Temporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions include temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time related details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human actions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying duration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video Scene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily available video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two key modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action Duration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically, TCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order based on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence with appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our approach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply applying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a further benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show that the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of action classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our framework practical in reality.**|

Existing OIQA methods have been developed and tested on homogeneously distorted omnidirectional images, but it is hard to transfer their success directly to the heterogeneously distorted omnidirectional images. In this paper, we conduct the largest study so far on OIQA, where we establish a large-scale database called OIQ-10K containing 10,000 omnidirectional images with both homogeneous and heterogeneous distortions. A comprehensive psychophysical study is elaborated to collect human opinions for each omnidirectional image, together with the spatial distributions (within local regions or globally) of distortions, and the head and eye movements of the subjects. Furthermore, we propose a novel multitask-derived adaptive feature-tailoring OIQA model named IQCaption360, which is capable of generating a quality caption for an omnidirectional image in a manner of textual template. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IQCaption360, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the proposed OIQ-10K database.

However, the performance evaluation of these studies is still largely reliant on visualization, with the superiority of studies often determined by human subjectivity. The metrics of quantitative evaluation also vary, making comprehensive comparisons difficult. We propose EraseEval, an evaluation method that differs from previous evaluation methods in that it involves three fundamental evaluation criteria: (1) How well does the prompt containing the target concept be reflected, (2) To what extent the concepts related to the erased concept can reduce the impact of the erased concept, and (3) Whether other concepts are preserved. These criteria are evaluated and integrated into a single metric, such that a lower score is given if any of the evaluations are low, leading to a more robust assessment. We experimentally evaluated baseline concept erasure methods, organized their characteristics, and identified challenges with them. Despite being fundamental evaluation criteria, some concept erasure methods failed to achieve high scores, which point toward future research directions for concept erasure methods.

However, acquiring such datasets is time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. To address these limitations, the use of synthetic data has gained attention as a viable alternative, allowing researchers to generate vast amounts of data while simulating various environmental contexts in a controlled setting. In this study, we investigate the use of synthetic data in robotics and navigation, specifically focusing on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR). In particular, we introduce a synthetic dataset created using the virtual environment of the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), along with an algorithm designed to generate a VPR dataset, without human supervision. Through a series of experiments centered on SLAM and VPR, we demonstrate that synthetic data derived from GTA V are qualitatively comparable to real-world data. Furthermore, these synthetic data can complement or even substitute real-world data in these applications. This study sets the stage for the creation of large-scale synthetic datasets, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future research and development.**|

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ml-jku/LaM-SLidE .**|

However, it remains challenging to produce perpetually realistic, view-consistent, and temporally coherent human avatars from a single image, as limited information is available in the single-view input setting. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose HumanGif, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing information. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.**|

Though existing methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often exhibit limitations due to constrained dataset diversity and the restricted amount of information derived from audio inputs. To address these challenges, we present VarGes, a novel variation-driven framework designed to enhance co-speech gesture generation by integrating visual stylistic cues while maintaining naturalness. Our approach begins with the Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) module, which seamlessly incorporates \textcolor{blue}{style-reference} video data into a 3D human pose estimation network to extract StyleCLIPS, thereby enriching the input with stylistic information. Subsequently, we employ the Variation-Compensation Style Encoder (VCSE), a transformer-style encoder equipped with an additive attention mechanism pooling layer, to robustly encode diverse StyleCLIPS representations and effectively manage stylistic variations. Finally, the Variation-Driven Gesture Predictor (VDGP) module fuses MFCC audio features with StyleCLIPS encodings via cross-attention, injecting this fused data into a cross-conditional autoregressive model to modulate 3D human gesture generation based on audio input and stylistic clues. The efficacy of our approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of gesture diversity and naturalness.

These models substantially mitigate flickering artifacts prevalent in prior models, enable longer and complex text prompts and generate longer videos with intricate, diverse motion patterns. Conventional VQA methods designed for simple text and basic motion patterns struggle to evaluate these content-rich videos. To this end, we propose \textbf{CRAVE} (\underline{C}ontent-\underline{R}ich \underline{A}IGC \underline{V}ideo \underline{E}valuator), specifically for the evaluation of Sora-era AIGC videos.

However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply VIBA to video deepfake detection, testing it on two architectures: the Xception model for spatial features and a VGG11-based model for capturing motion dynamics through optical flow. Using a custom dataset that reflects recent deepfake generation techniques, we adapt IBA to create relevance and optical flow maps, visually highlighting manipulated regions and motion inconsistencies. Our results show that VIBA generates temporally and spatially consistent explanations, which align closely with human annotations, thus providing interpretability for video classification and particularly for deepfake detection.**|

This atlas covers different levels of details of the human brain anatomy, from the organ to the substructure level, using a new dense labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas has been constructed averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution that were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the holiAtlas protocol has 350 different labels derived from 10 different delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at different scales to provide a holistic view of the brain at different levels in a coherent and consistent manner. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used for the development of new ultra-high resolution segmentation methods that can potentially leverage the early detection of neurological disorders.**|

While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based models to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a significant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual system in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans' ability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order motion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the intensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT motion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and a recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic videos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings about first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion, inspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing pathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented using a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired the ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which pure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order mechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical fluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our dual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of moving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from non-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to perceive second-order motion, as can humans. The resulting model effectively aligns with biological systems while generalizing to both first- and second-order motion phenomena in natural scenes.**|

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data.

Beyond body pose control, we connect a local control module with our model to capture identity-disentangled facial expressions, facilitating accurate expression transfer for enhanced realism in animated scenes. Together, these components form a unified framework capable of learning physical human motion and natural scene dynamics from a diverse blend of human and scene videos.

Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8% over GPT-4o and 5.8% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.**|

However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

This limitation is particularly evident in ADL tasks, where understanding detailed human-object interaction and human-centric motion is crucial for applications such as elderly monitoring and cognitive assessment. To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose an online ego2exo distillation approach to learn ego-augmented exo representations in LVLMs. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo training data, which is impractical to collect for real-world ADL scenarios. Consequently, we develop EgoMimic, a skeleton-guided method that can generate mimicked ego views from exocentric videos. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed EgoPerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos. Code, models, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/dominickrei/EgoExo4ADL.**|

Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.**|

Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

To address this need, we present RadGPT, an Anatomy-Aware Vision-Language AI Agent for generating detailed reports from CT scans. RadGPT first segments tumors, including benign cysts and malignant tumors, and their surrounding anatomical structures, then transforms this information into both structured reports and narrative reports. These reports provide tumor size, shape, location, attenuation, volume, and interactions with surrounding blood vessels and organs. Extensive evaluation on unseen hospitals shows that RadGPT can produce accurate reports, with high sensitivity/specificity for small tumor (<2 cm) detection: 80/73% for liver tumors, 92/78% for kidney tumors, and 77/77% for pancreatic tumors. For large tumors, sensitivity ranges from 89% to 97%. The results significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in abdominal CT report generation.   RadGPT generated reports for 17 public datasets. Through radiologist review and refinement, we have ensured the reports' accuracy, and created the first publicly available image-text 3D medical dataset, comprising over 1.8 million text tokens and 2.7 million images from 9,262 CT scans, including 2,947 tumor scans/reports of 8,562 tumor instances. Our reports can: (1) localize tumors in eight liver sub-segments and three pancreatic sub-segments annotated per-voxel; (2) determine pancreatic tumor stage (T1-T4) in 260 reports; and (3) present individual analyses of multiple tumors--rare in human-made reports. Importantly, 948 of the reports are for early-stage tumors.**|

This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.**|

Existing deep learning-based methods can reproduce natural age transformations; however, they only reproduce averaged transitions and fail to account for individual-specific appearances influenced by their life histories. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion model-based method for personalized age transformation. Our diffusion model takes a facial image and a target age as input and generates an age-edited face image as output. To reflect individual-specific features, we incorporate additional supervision using self-reference images, which are facial images of the same person at different ages. Specifically, we fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for personalized adaptation using approximately 3 to 5 self-reference images. Additionally, we design an effective prompt to enhance the performance of age editing and identity preservation. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to existing methods.

This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning.

Existing methods construct such supervision signals from videos, as they capture how objects change with various physical interactions. However, these models are usually built upon text-to-image diffusion models, so necessitate (i) massive training samples and (ii) an additional reference encoder to learn real-world dynamics and visual consistency. In this paper, we reformulate this task as an image-to-video generation problem, so that inherit powerful video diffusion priors to reduce training costs and ensure temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce FramePainter as an efficient instantiation of this formulation. Initialized with Stable Video Diffusion, it only uses a lightweight sparse control encoder to inject editing signals. Considering the limitations of temporal attention in handling large motion between two frames, we further propose matching attention to enlarge the receptive field while encouraging dense correspondence between edited and source image tokens. We highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of FramePainter across various of editing signals: it domainantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with far less training data, achieving highly seamless and coherent editing of images, \eg, automatically adjust the reflection of the cup. Moreover, FramePainter also exhibits exceptional generalization in scenarios not present in real-world videos, \eg, transform the clownfish into shark-like shape.

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.**|

However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.**|

While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.**|

While an individual LUT does not incur a high memory overhead, software and devices may need to store dozens to hundreds of LUTs that can take over 100 MB. This work aims to develop a neural network architecture that can encode hundreds of LUTs in a single compact representation. To this end, we propose a model with a memory footprint of less than 0.25 MB that can reconstruct 512 LUTs with only minor color distortion ( $\bar{\Delta}E_M$ $\leq$ 2.0) over the entire color gamut. We also show that our network can weight colors to provide further quality gains on natural image colors ($\bar{\Delta}{E}_M$ $\leq$ 1.0). Finally, we show that minor modifications to the network architecture enable a bijective encoding that produces LUTs that are invertible, allowing for reverse color processing.

Datasets with fine-grained action labels for moving people in industrial environments with mobile robots are scarce, as most existing datasets focus on social navigation in public spaces. This paper introduces the TH\"OR-MAGNI Act dataset, a substantial extension of the TH\"OR-MAGNI dataset, which captures participant movements alongside robots in diverse semantic and spatial contexts. TH\"OR-MAGNI Act provides 8.3 hours of manually labeled participant actions derived from egocentric videos recorded via eye-tracking glasses. These actions, aligned with the provided TH\"OR-MAGNI motion cues, follow a long-tailed distribution with diversified acceleration, velocity, and navigation distance profiles. We demonstrate the utility of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act for two tasks: action-conditioned trajectory prediction and joint action and trajectory prediction. We propose two efficient transformer-based models that outperform the baselines to address these tasks. These results underscore the potential of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act to develop predictive models for enhanced human-robot interaction in complex environments.**|

However, these models are far from real-time, often requiring many sampling steps that take minutes to generate even one second of video-significantly limiting practical use. We introduce OSA-LCM (One-Step Avatar Latent Consistency Model), paving the way for real-time diffusion-based avatars. Our method achieves comparable video quality to existing methods but requires only one sampling step, making it more than 10x faster. To accomplish this, we propose a novel avatar discriminator design that guides lip-audio consistency and motion expressiveness to enhance video quality in limited sampling steps. Additionally, we employ a second-stage training architecture using an editing fine-tuned method (EFT), transforming video generation into an editing task during training to effectively address the temporal gap challenge in single-step generation.

Recent studies have explored and exploited large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing, resulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still suffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of objects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by proposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo) method. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with the edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional Diffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the edited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting in a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated video. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with less border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling (IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant regions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be harmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that ReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and achieves superior video editing performance.**|

Current approaches either build specialized video models from scratch with enormous computational costs or add separate motion modules to image generators, both requiring learning temporal dynamics anew. We observe that modern image generation models possess underutilized potential in handling structured layouts with implicit temporal understanding. Building on this insight, we introduce GRID, which reformulates temporal sequences as grid layouts, enabling holistic processing of visual sequences while leveraging existing model capabilities. Through a parallel flow-matching training strategy with coarse-to-fine scheduling, our approach achieves up to 67 faster inference speeds while using <1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRID not only excels in temporal tasks from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing but also preserves strong performance in image generation, establishing itself as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.**|

Video watermarking addresses these challenges by embedding imperceptible signals into videos, allowing for identification. However, the rare open tools and methods often fall short on efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. To reduce these gaps, this paper introduces Video Seal, a comprehensive framework for neural video watermarking and a competitive open-sourced model. Our approach jointly trains an embedder and an extractor, while ensuring the watermark robustness by applying transformations in-between, e.g., video codecs. This training is multistage and includes image pre-training, hybrid post-training and extractor fine-tuning. We also introduce temporal watermark propagation, a technique to convert any image watermarking model to an efficient video watermarking model without the need to watermark every high-resolution frame. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in terms of speed, imperceptibility, and robustness. Video Seal achieves higher robustness compared to strong baselines especially under challenging distortions combining geometric transformations and video compression. Additionally, we provide new insights such as the impact of video compression during training, and how to compare methods operating on different payloads. Contributions in this work - including the codebase, models, and a public demo - are open-sourced under permissive licenses to foster further research and development in the field.**|

However, most existing methods perform this task offline and rely on time-consuming iterative processes, limiting their practical applications. To this end, we introduce the Large 4D Gaussian Reconstruction Model (DrivingRecon), a generalizable driving scene reconstruction model, which directly predicts 4D Gaussian from surround view videos. To better integrate the surround-view images, the Prune and Dilate Block (PD-Block) is proposed to eliminate overlapping Gaussian points between adjacent views and remove redundant background points. To enhance cross-temporal information, dynamic and static decoupling is tailored to better learn geometry and motion features. Experimental results demonstrate that DrivingRecon significantly improves scene reconstruction quality and novel view synthesis compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we explore applications of DrivingRecon in model pre-training, vehicle adaptation, and scene editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EnVision-Research/DriveRecon.**|

To address this, we introduce a dataset with 167.69 hours of multi-modal data, including text, images, videos, and music annotations. Based on this dataset, we propose MuMu-LLaMA, a model that leverages pre-trained encoders for music, images, and videos. For music generation, we integrate AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Our evaluation across four tasks--music understanding, text-to-music generation, prompt-based music editing, and multi-modal music generation--demonstrates that MuMu-LLaMA outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing its potential for multi-modal music applications.**|

The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively.

In doing so, these studies mainly transfer the inherent motion patterns from the source videos to the edited ones, where results with inferior consistency to user prompts are often observed, due to the lack of particular alignments between the delivered motions and edited contents. To address this limitation, we present a shape-consistent video editing method, namely StableV2V, in this paper. Our method decomposes the entire editing pipeline into several sequential procedures, where it edits the first video frame, then establishes an alignment between the delivered motions and user prompts, and eventually propagates the edited contents to all other frames based on such alignment. Furthermore, we curate a testing benchmark, namely DAVIS-Edit, for a comprehensive evaluation of video editing, considering various types of prompts and difficulties. Experimental results and analyses illustrate the outperforming performance, visual consistency, and inference efficiency of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art studies.**|

This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

To this end, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of recent autoregressive methods (VAR and MaskGIT) for entropy modeling and evaluate our approach on the large-scale MSCOCO-30k benchmark.

Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$ -Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.**|

This assessment helps determine the fracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention. However, clinical data indicate that many VCFs exhibit irregular compression, complicating accurate diagnosis. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding VCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-VCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and our private dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss. This practical tool enhances diagnostic sensitivity in clinical settings and assisting in surgical decision-making. Our code is available: https://github.com/zhibaishouheilab/HealthiVert-GAN.**|

To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.**|

Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the evaluation and follow-up of these tumours, allowing specialists to analyse their morphology. However, existing methods for automatic glioma segmentation often lack generalization capability across other brain tumour domains, require extensive computational resources, or fail to fully utilize the multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) data used to delineate them. In this work, we introduce GBT-SAM, a novel Generalizable Brain Tumour (GBT) framework that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to brain tumour segmentation tasks. Our method employs a two-step training protocol: first, fine-tuning the patch embedding layer to process the entire mp-MRI modalities, and second, incorporating parameter-efficient LoRA blocks and a Depth-Condition block into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture inter-slice correlations. GBT-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adult Glioma dataset (Dice Score of $93.54$ ) while demonstrating robust generalization across Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. Furthermore, GBT-SAM uses less than 6.5M trainable parameters, thus offering an efficient solution for brain tumour segmentation. \\ Our code and models are available at https://github.com/vpulab/med-sam-brain .**|

As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative assessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

However, existing ICL models, which take 2D images as input, struggle to fully leverage the 3D anatomical structures in neuroimages, leading to a lack of global awareness and suboptimal performance. In this regard, we introduce Neuroverse3D, an ICL model capable of performing multiple neuroimaging tasks (e.g., segmentation, denoising, inpainting) in 3D. Neuroverse3D overcomes the large memory consumption due to 3D inputs through adaptive parallel-sequential context processing and a U-shape fusion strategy, allowing it to handle an unlimited number of context images. Additionally, we propose an optimized loss to balance multi-task training and enhance the focus on anatomical structures. Our study incorporates 43,674 3D scans from 19 neuroimaging datasets and evaluates Neuroverse3D on 14 diverse tasks using held-out test sets. The results demonstrate that Neuroverse3D significantly outperforms existing ICL models and closely matches the performance of task-specific models.

While significant progress has been made in developing objective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to Scaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a predictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual quality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring the largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the mentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image and text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on visual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos). Leveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified model capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special improvements for handling long-text prompt alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Q-Eval-Score achieves superior performance on both visual quality and alignment, with strong generalization capabilities across other benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant value of the Q-EVAL-100K dataset. Data and codes will be available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/Q-Eval.**|

Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

The challenge of improving user experiences in complex systems with search and recommendation (S\&R) services has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry these years. However, the lack of high-quality datasets has limited the research progress on multimodal S\&R. To address the growing need for developing better S\&R services, we present a novel multimodal information retrieval dataset in this paper, namely Qilin. The dataset is collected from Xiaohongshu, a popular social platform with over 300 million monthly active users and an average search penetration rate of over 70\%. In contrast to existing datasets, \textsf{Qilin} offers a comprehensive collection of user sessions with heterogeneous results like image-text notes, video notes, commercial notes, and direct answers, facilitating the development of advanced multimodal neural retrieval models across diverse task settings. To better model user satisfaction and support the analysis of heterogeneous user behaviors, we also collect extensive APP-level contextual signals and genuine user feedback. Notably, Qilin contains user-favored answers and their referred results for search requests triggering the Deep Query Answering (DQA) module.

Current approaches either rely on expensive labelled datasets, struggle with seasonal variations, or require multiple observations for confirmation (which delays detection). To address these challenges, this work presents SHAZAM - Self-Supervised Change Monitoring for Hazard Detection and Mapping. SHAZAM uses a lightweight conditional UNet to generate expected images of a region of interest (ROI) for any day of the year, allowing for the direct modelling of normal seasonal changes and the ability to distinguish potential hazards. A modified structural similarity measure compares the generated images with actual satellite observations to compute region-level anomaly scores and pixel-level hazard maps. Additionally, a theoretically grounded seasonal threshold eliminates the need for dataset-specific optimisation. Evaluated on four diverse datasets that contain bushfires (wildfires), burned regions, extreme and out-of-season snowfall, floods, droughts, algal blooms, and deforestation, SHAZAM achieved F1 score improvements of between 0.066 and 0.234 over existing methods. This was achieved primarily through more effective hazard detection (higher recall) while using only 473K parameters. SHAZAM demonstrated superior mapping capabilities through higher spatial resolution and improved ability to suppress background features while accentuating both immediate and gradual hazards. SHAZAM has been established as an effective and generalisable solution for hazard detection and mapping across different geographical regions and a diverse range of hazards.

However, effectively capturing structural features while integrating them with contextual information from retinal images remains a challenge. In this work, we propose segmentation-guided dual-branch network for retinal disease diagnosis using retinal images and their segmentation maps, named SegImgNet. SegImgNet incorporates a segmentation module to generate multi-scale retinal structural feature maps from retinal images. The classification module employs two encoders to independently extract features from segmented images and retinal images for disease classification. To further enhance feature extraction, we introduce the Segmentation-Guided Attention (SGA) block, which leverages feature maps from the segmentation module to refine the classification process. We evaluate SegImgNet on the public AIROGS dataset and the private e-ROP dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SegImgNet consistently outperforms existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness in retinal disease diagnosis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hawk-sudo/SegImgNet.**|

While current deep generative models can produce high-resolution anatomically accurate templates for population-wide studies, their ability to predict future aging trajectories for individuals remains limited, particularly in capturing subject-specific neuroanatomical variations over time. In this study, we introduce Individualized Brain Synthesis (InBrainSyn), a framework for synthesizing high-resolution subject-specific longitudinal MRI scans that simulate neurodegeneration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging. InBrainSyn uses a parallel transport algorithm to adapt the population-level aging trajectories learned by a generative deep template network, enabling individualized aging synthesis. As InBrainSyn uses diffeomorphic transformations to simulate aging, the synthesized images are topologically consistent with the original anatomy by design. We evaluated InBrainSyn both quantitatively and qualitatively on AD and healthy control cohorts from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies - version 3 dataset. Experimentally, InBrainSyn can also model neuroanatomical transitions between normal aging and AD. An evaluation of an external set supports its generalizability. Overall, with only a single baseline scan, InBrainSyn synthesizes realistic 3D spatiotemporal T1w MRI scans, producing personalized longitudinal aging trajectories. The code for InBrainSyn is available at: https://github.com/Fjr9516/InBrainSyn.**|

Existing portrait animation methods fail to achieve relightable portraits because they do not separate and manipulate intrinsic (identity and appearance) and extrinsic (pose and lighting) features. In this paper, we present a Lighting Controllable Video Diffusion model (LCVD) for high-fidelity, relightable portrait animation. We address this limitation by distinguishing these feature types through dedicated subspaces within the feature space of a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, we employ the 3D mesh, pose, and lighting-rendered shading hints of the portrait to represent the extrinsic attributes, while the reference represents the intrinsic attributes. In the training phase, we employ a reference adapter to map the reference into the intrinsic feature subspace and a shading adapter to map the shading hints into the extrinsic feature subspace. By merging features from these subspaces, the model achieves nuanced control over lighting, pose, and expression in generated animations. Extensive evaluations show that LCVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lighting realism, image quality, and video consistency, setting a new benchmark in relightable portrait animation.**|

However, the existing trajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion trajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions between the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation, we propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video generation, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some objects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the dynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion control of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception module and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object perception module employs visual language models to capture the position and category information of various objects within the image. The Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input and conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for each of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model for video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction (VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video generation methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of interactions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used for accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag achieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object motion control. Our benchmark, codes, and models will be available at https://github.com/WesLee88524/C-Drag-Official-Repo.**|

Traditional VR-VQA methods trained on static datasets with limited distortion diversity struggle to balance correlation and precision. This becomes particularly critical when generalizing to diverse VR content and continually adapting to dynamic and evolving video distribution variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for assessing the perceptual quality of VR videos, Adaptive Score Alignment Learning (ASAL). ASAL integrates correlation loss with error loss to enhance alignment with human subjective ratings and precision in predicting perceptual quality. In particular, ASAL can naturally adapt to continually changing distributions through a feature space smoothing process that enhances generalization to unseen content. To further improve continual adaptation to dynamic VR environments, we extend ASAL with adaptive memory replay as a novel Continul Learning (CL) framework. Unlike traditional CL models, ASAL utilizes key frame extraction and feature adaptation to address the unique challenges of non-stationary variations with both the computation and storage restrictions of VR devices. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for VR-VQA and its CL counterpart, introducing new data splits and evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAL outperforms recent strong baseline models, achieving overall correlation gains of up to 4.78\% in the static joint training setting and 12.19\% in the dynamic CL setting on various datasets. This validates the effectiveness of ASAL in addressing the inherent challenges of VR-VQA.Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/ASAL_CVQA.**|

Thus, the use of memorizing generative models in the medical domain can jeopardize patient privacy. We propose a framework for identifying replicas, i.e. nearly identical copies of the training data, in synthetic medical image datasets. Our REpLIca deteCTion (RELICT) framework for medical image generative models evaluates image similarity using three complementary approaches: (1) voxel-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis by a pretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. Two clinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated: non-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight MR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was used as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report the balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification performance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50 generated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively. Image-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a balanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use case. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not possible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.79. Replica detection is a crucial but neglected validation step for the development of generative models in medical imaging. The proposed RELICT framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for replica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical medical image synthesis.**|

As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints. However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications. In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge. We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size. Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns. Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset. Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience. In addition, our algorithm performs similarly to the modified state-of-the-art solution regarding traditional itinerary recommendation metrics.**|

VaViM is a simple auto-regressive video model that predicts frames using spatio-temporal token sequences. We show that it captures the semantics and dynamics of driving scenes. VaVAM, the video-action model, leverages the learned representations of VaViM to generate driving trajectories through imitation learning. Together, the models form a complete perception-to-action pipeline. We evaluate our models in open- and closed-loop driving scenarios, revealing that video-based pre-training holds promise for autonomous driving. Key insights include the semantic richness of the learned representations, the benefits of scaling for video synthesis, and the complex relationship between model size, data, and safety metrics in closed-loop evaluations.

Accurate and automated segmentation of these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is crucial to assess tumor burden and monitor disease progression. In this study, we present and analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed T2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF segmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use the MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with a high-risk zone for NFs. This mask is concatenated with the input image as anatomical context information for NF segmentation. The second stage employs an ensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF segmentation confidence mask. In the final stage, tumor candidates are extracted from the confidence mask and classified based on radiomic features, distinguishing tumors from non-tumor regions and reducing false positives. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three test sets representing different conditions: in-domain data (test set 1), varying imaging protocols and field strength (test set 2), and low tumor burden cases (test set 3). Experimental results show a 68% improvement in per-scan Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a 21% increase in per-tumor DSC, and a two-fold improvement in F1 score for tumor detection in high tumor burden cases by integrating anatomy information. The method is integrated into the 3D Slicer platform for practical clinical use, with the code publicly accessible.**|

However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4 $\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a dice coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8\% and 18.6\% improvements in DICE and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.**|

However, the performance evaluation of these studies is still largely reliant on visualization, with the superiority of studies often determined by human subjectivity. The metrics of quantitative evaluation also vary, making comprehensive comparisons difficult. We propose EraseEval, an evaluation method that differs from previous evaluation methods in that it involves three fundamental evaluation criteria: (1) How well does the prompt containing the target concept be reflected, (2) To what extent the concepts related to the erased concept can reduce the impact of the erased concept, and (3) Whether other concepts are preserved. These criteria are evaluated and integrated into a single metric, such that a lower score is given if any of the evaluations are low, leading to a more robust assessment. We experimentally evaluated baseline concept erasure methods, organized their characteristics, and identified challenges with them. Despite being fundamental evaluation criteria, some concept erasure methods failed to achieve high scores, which point toward future research directions for concept erasure methods.

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM.

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output and accordingly adjust the prompt before committing to full-resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability.**|

We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by Open-Sora running on high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices, expanding accessibility, ensuring user privacy, reducing dependence on cloud infrastructure, and lowering associated costs. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation capabilities on commodity mobile and embedded devices. The code implementation is publicly available at an GitHub repository: https://github.com/eai-lab/On-device-Sora.**|

These models substantially mitigate flickering artifacts prevalent in prior models, enable longer and complex text prompts and generate longer videos with intricate, diverse motion patterns. Conventional VQA methods designed for simple text and basic motion patterns struggle to evaluate these content-rich videos. To this end, we propose \textbf{CRAVE} (\underline{C}ontent-\underline{R}ich \underline{A}IGC \underline{V}ideo \underline{E}valuator), specifically for the evaluation of Sora-era AIGC videos. CRAVE proposes the multi-granularity text-temporal fusion that aligns long-form complex textual semantics with video dynamics. Additionally, CRAVE leverages the hybrid motion-fidelity modeling to assess temporal artifacts. Furthermore, given the straightforward prompts and content in current AIGC VQA datasets, we introduce \textbf{CRAVE-DB}, a benchmark featuring content-rich videos from next-generation models paired with elaborate prompts. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed CRAVE achieves excellent results on multiple AIGC VQA benchmarks, demonstrating a high degree of alignment with human perception. All data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/littlespray/CRAVE.**|

Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.**|

Previous works ignore the problem of distribution shifts, resulting in poor generalization under different distribution. A natural solution would be to adapt the model to a new test distribution, but this cannot be done if the test input comes without a ground truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel test time training framework which uses self-supervision to adapt the model to a new distribution without requiring any labels. Indeed, before performing frame interpolation on each test video, the model is trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task, such as rotation prediction or image reconstruction. We conduct experiments on two publicly available 4D medical image interpolation datasets, Cardiac and 4D-Lung. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance across various evaluation metrics on both datasets. It achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio values, 33.73dB on Cardiac and 34.02dB on 4D-Lung. Our method not only advances 4D medical image interpolation but also provides a template for domain adaptation in other fields such as image segmentation and image registration.**|

Recent advances in Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) for autonomous driving underscore the limitations of RGB-based approaches, which struggle under motion blur, poor lighting, and adverse weather. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and low latency, address these challenges by providing asynchronous data that complements RGB inputs. We present DSEC-SSC, the first real-world benchmark specifically designed for event-aided SSC, which includes a novel 4D labeling pipeline for generating dense, visibility-aware labels that adapt dynamically to object motion. Our proposed RGB-Event fusion framework, EvSSC, introduces an Event-aided Lifting Module (ELM) that effectively bridges 2D RGB-Event features to 3D space, enhancing view transformation and the robustness of 3D volume construction across SSC models. Extensive experiments on DSEC-SSC and simulated SemanticKITTI-E demonstrate that EvSSC is adaptable to both transformer-based and LSS-based SSC architectures. Notably, evaluations on SemanticKITTI-C demonstrate that EvSSC achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy across five degradation modes and both In-domain and Out-of-domain settings, achieving up to a 52.5% relative improvement in mIoU when the image sensor partially fails. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of EvSSC under motion blur and extreme weather conditions, where autonomous driving is challenged. The established datasets and our codebase will be made publicly at https://github.com/Pandapan01/EvSSC.**|

Inspired by BERT's success in capturing deep bidirectional contexts in natural language processing, similar frameworks have been adapted to other modalities such as audio, with models like BEATs extending the bidirectional training paradigm to audio signals using vector quantization (VQ). However, these frameworks face challenges, notably their dependence on a single codebook for quantization, which may not capture the complex, multifaceted nature of signals. In addition, inefficiencies in codebook utilization lead to underutilized code vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce BRIDLE (Bidirectional Residual Quantization Interleaved Discrete Learning Encoder), a self-supervised encoder pretraining framework that incorporates residual quantization (RQ) into the bidirectional training process, and is generalized for pretraining with audio, image, and video. Using multiple hierarchical codebooks, RQ enables fine-grained discretization in the latent space, enhancing representation quality. BRIDLE involves an interleaved training procedure between the encoder and tokenizer. We evaluate BRIDLE on audio understanding tasks using classification benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate competitive performance on image classification and video classification tasks, showing consistent improvements over traditional VQ methods in downstream performance.**|

This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on our proposed LongerVideos benchmark-comprising over 160 videos totaling 134+ hours across lecture, documentary, and entertainment categories-VideoRAG demonstrates substantial performance compared to existing RAG alternatives and long video understanding methods.

However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a conventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This conventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community.

In this study, we introduce a Full Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where the feature representation network with modernized convolution blocks extracts full-scale information and the guided convolution block refines that information. Attention-guided filter is introduced to the guided convolution block under the interpretation that the filter behaves like the unsharp mask filter. Passing full-scale information to the attention block allows for the generation of improved attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, resulting in performance enhancement of the segmentation network. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, which enhances the scalability of the proposed approach. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments also show that the proposed network demonstrates competitive results compared to current SOTA models on various public datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with much smaller parameter sizes. Lastly, by applying the proposed model to facial wrinkle segmentation, we confirmed the potential for scalability to similar tasks in other domains.

Unlike existing datasets, VDAct includes longer and more complex video sequences that depict a variety of event-driven activities that require advanced contextual understanding for accurate response generation. The dataset comprises 3,000 dialogues with over 30,000 question-and-answer pairs, derived from 1,000 videos with diverse activity scenarios. VDAct displays a notably challenging characteristic due to its broad spectrum of activity scenarios and wide range of question types. Empirical studies on state-of-the-art vision foundation models highlight their limitations in addressing certain question types on our dataset. Furthermore, VDEval, which integrates dialogue session history and video content summaries extracted from our supplementary Knowledge Graphs to evaluate individual responses, demonstrates a significantly higher correlation with human assessments on the VDAct dataset than existing evaluation metrics that rely solely on the context of single dialogue turns.**|

Semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly with pseudo-labeling, shows promise over fully supervised methods but often lacks reliable pseudo-label assessment mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose a novel SSL framework, Dual Invariance Self-Training (DIST), that incorporates both Temporal and Transformation Invariance to enhance surgical phase recognition. Our two-step self-training process dynamically selects reliable pseudo-labels, ensuring robust pseudo-supervision. Our approach mitigates the risk of noisy pseudo-labels, steering decision boundaries toward true data distribution and improving generalization to unseen data. Evaluations on Cataract and Cholec80 datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art SSL approaches, consistently surpassing both supervised and SSL baselines across various network architectures.**|

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

Supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods, trained using simulated datasets, often struggle to perform well on real clinical CT images due to a substantial domain gap. Although state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods use pseudo ground-truths generated by a prior network to mitigate this issue, their reliance on a fixed prior limits both the quality and quantity of these pseudo ground-truths, introducing confirmation bias and reducing clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Radiologist-In-the-loop SElf-training framework for MAR, termed RISE-MAR, which can integrate radiologists' feedback into the semi-supervised learning process, progressively improving the quality and quantity of pseudo ground-truths for enhanced generalization on real clinical CT images. For quality assurance, we introduce a clinical quality assessor model that emulates radiologist evaluations, effectively selecting high-quality pseudo ground-truths for semi-supervised training. For quantity assurance, our self-training framework iteratively generates additional high-quality pseudo ground-truths, expanding the clinical dataset and further improving model generalization. Extensive experimental results on multiple clinical datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of our RISE-MAR over state-of-the-art methods, advancing the development of MAR models for practical application.

While such sanitized conditions simplify evaluation, they fail to capture the unpredictable, noisy complexities of real-world environments. Dynamic motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization perturbations lead to sharp performance declines when these models are deployed in practice, revealing an urgent need for frameworks that embrace and excel under real-world noise. To bridge this gap, we tackle three core challenges: scalable data generation, comprehensive benchmarking, and model robustness enhancement. First, we introduce a scalable noisy data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse datasets simulating complex motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization errors. Second, we leverage this pipeline to create Robust-Ego3D, a benchmark rigorously designed to expose noise-induced performance degradation, highlighting the limitations of current learning-based methods in ego-motion accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Third, we propose Correspondence-guided Gaussian Splatting (CorrGS), a novel test-time adaptation method that progressively refines an internal clean 3D representation by aligning noisy observations with rendered RGB-D frames from clean 3D map, enhancing geometric alignment and appearance restoration through visual correspondence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that CorrGS consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving rapid motion and dynamic illumination.**|

CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore, relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more generally to the computational imaging community.**|
