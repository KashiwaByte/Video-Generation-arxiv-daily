Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient.

While potentially beneficial, this synthetic data generation process has been relatively underexplored in cancer histopathology. One algorithm for synthesising a realistic image is diffusion; it iteratively converts an image to noise and learns the recovery process from this noise [Wang and Vastola, 2023]. While effective, it is highly computationally expensive for high-resolution images, rendering it infeasible for histopathology. The development of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) has allowed us to learn the representation of complex high-resolution images in a latent space. A vital by-product of this is the ability to compress high-resolution images to space and recover them lossless. The marriage of diffusion and VAEs allows us to carry out diffusion in the latent space of an autoencoder, enabling us to leverage the realistic generative capabilities of diffusion while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.

Through extensive controlled synthetic experiments and testing on real datasets, we demonstrate that SAM's performance is noticeably correlated with these factors. We link these behaviors under the concept of \"textural confusion\", where SAM misinterprets local structure as global texture, leading to over-segmentation, or struggles to differentiate objects from similarly textured backgrounds.

Despite these advances, we find that current VLMs lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances few-shot localization performance without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored to personalized localization.

We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification.

However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging.

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods leverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud sequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are typically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large memory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we propose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to compactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are generally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which consist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach builds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level separately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change, and adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content over different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of Gaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian hierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment with a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory usage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage usage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently handling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality.

While they can only generate short videos each time, existing methods achieve long video generation by iteratively calling the VGMs, using the last-frame output as the condition for the next-round generation. However, the last frame only contains short-term fine-grained information about the scene, resulting in inconsistency in the long horizon. To address this, we propose an Omni World modeL (Owl-1) to produce long-term coherent and comprehensive conditions for consistent long video generation. As videos are observations of the underlying evolving world, we propose to model the long-term developments in a latent space and use VGMs to film them into videos. Specifically, we represent the world with a latent state variable which can be decoded into explicit video observations. These observations serve as a basis for anticipating temporal dynamics which in turn update the state variable. The interaction between evolving dynamics and persistent state enhances the diversity and consistency of the long videos. Extensive experiments show that Owl-1 achieves comparable performance with SOTA methods on VBench-I2V and VBench-Long, validating its ability to generate high-quality video observations.

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules.

Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos.

Due to the limited control signals provided by sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment. However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input, which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks.

We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average.

Hanja is an ancient language used in Korea before the 20th century, whose characters were borrowed from old Chinese but had evolved in Korea for centuries. Modern Koreans and Chinese cannot understand Korean historical documents without substantial additional help, and while previous efforts have produced some Korean and English translations, this requires in-depth expertise, and so most of the documents are not translated into any modern language. To address this gap, we present HERITAGE, the first open-source Hanja NLP toolkit to assist in understanding and translating the unexplored Korean historical documents written in Hanja. HERITAGE is a web-based platform providing model predictions of three critical tasks in historical document understanding via Hanja language models: punctuation restoration, named entity recognition, and machine translation (MT). HERITAGE also provides an interactive glossary, which provides the character-level reading of the Hanja characters in modern Korean, as well as character-level English definition. HERITAGE serves two purposes. First, anyone interested in these documents can get a general understanding from the model predictions and the interactive glossary, especially MT outputs in Korean and English. Second, since the model outputs are not perfect, Hanja experts can revise them to produce better annotations and translations.

We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification.

Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size.

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues.

However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification.

Building on prior approaches centered on human pose control, X-Dyna addresses key shortcomings causing the loss of dynamic details, enhancing the lifelike qualities of human video animations. At the core of our approach is the Dynamics-Adapter, a lightweight module that effectively integrates reference appearance context into the spatial attentions of the diffusion backbone while preserving the capacity of motion modules in synthesizing fluid and intricate dynamic details. Beyond body pose control, we connect a local control module with our model to capture identity-disentangled facial expressions, facilitating accurate expression transfer for enhanced realism in animated scenes. Together, these components form a unified framework capable of learning physical human motion and natural scene dynamics from a diverse blend of human and scene videos.

Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality.

Existing methods construct such supervision signals from videos, as they capture how objects change with various physical interactions. However, these models are usually built upon text-to-image diffusion models, so necessitate (i) massive training samples and (ii) an additional reference encoder to learn real-world dynamics and visual consistency. In this paper, we reformulate this task as an image-to-video generation problem, so that inherit powerful video diffusion priors to reduce training costs and ensure temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce FramePainter as an efficient instantiation of this formulation. Initialized with Stable Video Diffusion, it only uses a lightweight sparse control encoder to inject editing signals. Considering the limitations of temporal attention in handling large motion between two frames, we further propose matching attention to enlarge the receptive field while encouraging dense correspondence between edited and source image tokens. We highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of FramePainter across various of editing signals: it domainantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with far less training data, achieving highly seamless and coherent editing of images, \\eg, automatically adjust the reflection of the cup.

However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.**|\n", "2501.01790": "|**2025-01-03**|**[Ingredients: Blending Custom Photos with Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01790)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/feizc/ingredients)**|**This paper presents a powerful framework to customize video creations by incorporating multiple specific identity (ID) photos, with video diffusion Transformers, referred to as \\texttt{Ingredients}.

Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control.

While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training.

Recent advances based on diffusion models typically rely on separate networks for reference appearance feature extraction and target visual generation, leading to inconsistent domain gaps between references and targets. In this paper, we frame the task as a spatially-conditioned inpainting problem, where the target image is inpainted to maintain appearance consistency with the reference. This approach enables the reference features to guide the generation of pose-compliant targets within a unified denoising network, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Additionally, to better maintain the reference appearance information, we impose a causal feature interaction framework, in which reference features can only query from themselves, while target features can query appearance information from both the reference and the target. To further enhance computational efficiency and flexibility, in practical implementation, we decompose the spatially-conditioned generation process into two stages: reference appearance extraction and conditioned target generation. Both stages share a single denoising network, with interactions restricted to self-attention layers. This proposed method ensures flexible control over the appearance of generated human images and videos. By fine-tuning existing base diffusion models on human video data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to unseen human identities and poses without requiring additional per-instance fine-tuning.

Existing G2P methods typically treat sign poses as discrete three-dimensional coordinates and directly fit them, which overlooks the relative positional relationships among joints. To this end, we provide a new perspective, constraining joint associations and gesture details by modeling the limb bones to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated poses. In this work, we propose a pioneering iconicity disentangled diffusion framework, termed Sign-IDD, specifically designed for SLP. Sign-IDD incorporates a novel Iconicity Disentanglement (ID) module to bridge the gap between relative positions among joints. The ID module disentangles the conventional 3D joint representation into a 4D bone representation, comprising the 3D spatial direction vector and 1D spatial distance vector between adjacent joints. Additionally, an Attribute Controllable Diffusion (ACD) module is introduced to further constrain joint associations, in which the attribute separation layer aims to separate the bone direction and length attributes, and the attribute control layer is designed to guide the pose generation by leveraging the above attributes. The ACD module utilizes the gloss embeddings as semantic conditions and finally generates sign poses from noise embeddings.

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality.

Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process.

While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based models to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a significant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual system in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans' ability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order motion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the intensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT motion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and a recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic videos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings about first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion, inspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing pathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented using a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired the ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which pure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order mechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical fluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our dual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of moving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from non-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to perceive second-order motion, as can humans. The resulting model effectively aligns with biological systems while generalizing to both first- and second-order motion phenomena in natural scenes.**|\n", "2501.12368": "|**2025-01-21**|**[InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward: A Simple Yet Effective Multi-Modal Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12368)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/internlm/internlm-xcomposer)**|**Despite the promising performance of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in visual understanding, they occasionally generate incorrect outputs.

However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps.

While an individual LUT does not incur a high memory overhead, software and devices may need to store dozens to hundreds of LUTs that can take over 100 MB. This work aims to develop a neural network architecture that can encode hundreds of LUTs in a single compact representation.

CRAVE proposes the multi-granularity text-temporal fusion that aligns long-form complex textual semantics with video dynamics. Additionally, CRAVE leverages the hybrid motion-fidelity modeling to assess temporal artifacts. Furthermore, given the straightforward prompts and content in current AIGC VQA datasets, we introduce \\textbf{CRAVE-DB}, a benchmark featuring content-rich videos from next-generation models paired with elaborate prompts. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed CRAVE achieves excellent results on multiple AIGC VQA benchmarks, demonstrating a high degree of alignment with human perception.

Building on Open-Sora, On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to address the challenges of diffusion-based text-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive denoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based approach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive token-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens along the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them into memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the challenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone 15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is capable of generating high-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by Open-Sora running on high-end GPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices, expanding accessibility, ensuring user privacy, reducing dependence on cloud infrastructure, and lowering associated costs. We envision the proposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing state-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation capabilities on commodity mobile and embedded devices.

Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.**|\n", "2502.08826": "|**2025-02-17**|**[Ask in Any Modality: A Comprehensive Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08826)**|**null**|**[link](https://github.com/llm-lab-org/multimodal-rag-survey)**|**Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations and outdated knowledge due to their reliance on static training data.

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM.
